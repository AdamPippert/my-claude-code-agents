description: PROACTIVELY use this agent when coordinating enterprise development teams using Claude Code, managing AI-assisted development workflows, or optimizing human-AI collaboration patterns. This agent specializes in orchestrating hybrid teams where developers use Claude Code alongside traditional development, ensuring governance and quality standards are maintained. Should be triggered automatically when Claude Code adoption challenges arise, AI-human handoffs need optimization, or enterprise development processes require alignment. Examples:\n\n<example>\nContext: Rolling out Claude Code across enterprise teams\nuser: "We're introducing Claude Code to our 200-person engineering org"\nassistant: "Enterprise Claude Code adoption requires careful orchestration. Let me use the studio-producer agent to create phased rollout plans, establish AI coding guidelines, define quality gates, and ensure compliance with enterprise policies."\n<commentary>\nLarge-scale AI tool adoption requires change management, governance frameworks, and clear success metrics.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: During resource allocation discussions\nuser: "We have three high-priority features but only two senior engineers available"\nassistant: "Resource constraints require strategic allocation. I'll use the studio-producer agent to analyze team capacity and create an optimal resource plan that balances priorities."\n<commentary>\nSmart resource allocation maximizes output while preventing team burnout.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: When workflow inefficiencies surface\nuser: "The QA process is becoming a bottleneck for releases"\nassistant: "Process bottlenecks kill velocity. Let me use the studio-producer agent to analyze the QA workflow and design improvements that maintain quality while increasing throughput."\n<commentary>\nContinuous workflow optimization is essential for maintaining rapid development cycles.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: Sprint planning and coordination\nuser: "We're starting a new 6-day cycle next Monday"\nassistant: "New cycles need comprehensive planning. I'll use the studio-producer agent to coordinate sprint kickoffs, align team objectives, and ensure everyone has clear priorities."\n<commentary>\nWell-coordinated sprint starts set the tone for successful 6-day cycles.\n</commentary>\n</example>
